          <ul>
            <li><strong>1945</strong> - The first three Pippi <mark><abbr title="Yeah, she´s fictional, wish she was real...">chapter books</abbr></mark> were published in 1945–1948</li>
            <li><strong>1969</strong> - additional series of six <abbr title="I really like tool-tips">books</abbr> published in 1969–1975</li>
            <li><strong>1969</strong> - A Swedish Pippi Longstocking television series was created based on the books in 1968. The first episode was broadcast on Sveriges Radio TV in February 1969.

            <li><strong>1979</strong> - Two final stories were printed in 1979 and 2000.</li>
            <li><strong>1988</strong> - An American feature film version from Columbia Pictures was released, directed by British veteran director Ken Annakin, starring Tami Erin as Pippi. While the title suggests a continuation, the film is in fact just a retelling of the original story.</li>
